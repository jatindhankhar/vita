[![Build status](https://github.com/junnlikestea/vita/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/junnlikestea/vita/actions)

Vita is a tool to gather subdomains from passive sources much like [tomnomnom's assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder).

# Test commit to understand comparison API

### Installation
Precompiled binaries for vita are available in the [releases](https://github.com/junnlikestea/vita/releases) tab. Just pick your platform and extract the archive that contains the binary.

### Building it yourself 
If you want to build it yourself you will need to install Rust, you can get the [official installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) from the Rust website.

To build Vita:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/junnlikestea/vita
$ cd vita
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/vita --version
```

### Usage

**With a single domain and collecting data from free sources**

```
vita -d hackerone.com
```
By default the results will be unique, and will filter subdomains not related 
to your root domain, or domains if you choose to supply multiple.

**Collecting data only on a specific subdomain**

If you only want to collect results related to a specific subdomain you can use
the `--subs-only` flag. This will cause vita to run on the actual domain and not
the root domain. Results will be filtered to anything that ends with the input
domain or domains.
```
vita -d api.hackerone.com --subs-only
```

**With a list of domains from a file**

```
vita -f path/to/domains.txt
```

**With a list of domains from stdin**

```
vita < /path/to/domains.txt
```

**Outputting results as they're received**

You can output results as they arrive as opposed to once all sources finish using
the `--flush` flag. You might want to use this flag when you're running vita on a
small vps without much memory. When this flag is active vita will not remove duplicates,
so you may want to pipe it through something like `sort -u`.
```
vita -d hackerone.com --flush
```

**Collecting data using paid sources**

If you want to include sources which require API keys, add the `-a` or `-all` flag, for example:
```
vita -d hackerone.com -a
``` 
By default it will just ignore services you don't supply keys for.

If you would like some more verbose output you can use the `-v` flag. There are
different levels of verbosity ranging from noisy to informational, most of the
time I just use `info`. This is all printing to stderr, so it won't be captured
in the results.
* `info`: General information like how many results each source returned.
* `debug`: Lots and lots of information about what's going on under the hood.
```
vita -d hackerone.com -v info
```

### Common error - Too many open files
Vita uses async concurrent http requests under the hood. If you encounter an error 
similar to *"Too many open files"* it means that there isn't enough available file descriptors on 
your system. You can fix this by increasing the hard and soft limits. There are 
lots of different guides available to increase the limits [but here is one for linux](https://www.tecmint.com/increase-set-open-file-limits-in-linux/). 

### Sources
* SonarSearch
* C99
* ProjectDiscovery Chaos
* AnubisDB
* Alienvault
* Binaryedge 
* Certspotter
* Crt.sh
* Hackertarget
* Threatcrowd
* VirusTotal
* Sublis3r
* Security Trails
* Spyse
* Urlscan.io
* Facebook
* Threatminer
* Wayback Machine
* IntelligenceX
* PassiveTotal

### How to set your Api Keys
Add a `.env` file to the tool directory or add the following to your existing `.env` file:
* Binaryedge:
	* Needs `BINARYEDGE_TOKEN` set
* ProjectDiscovery Chaos
	* Needs `CHAOS_KEY` set
* Facebook:
	* Needs `FB_APP_ID` and `FB_APP_SECRET` set.
* Spyse:
	* Needs `SPYSE_TOKEN` set.
* Security Trails:
	* Needs `SECURITY_TRAILS_KEY` set.
* C99: 
	* Needs `C99_KEY` set.
* PassiveTotal:
	* Needs `PASSIVETOTAL_KEY` and `PASSIVETOTAL_SECRET` set
	* Can be found under the account settings page.
* IntelligenceX:
	* Needs `INTELX_KEY` and `INTELX_URL` to be set
	* Can be found under the [developer tab](https://intelx.io/account?tab=developer)

If you hit rate limits or authentication fails, the source will just be ignored from the list of potential sources.

### A note on tuning the concurrency
Currently Vita will limit the search for data to 200 root domains concurrently. If you would like to 
change that limit you can use the `-c` flag:

```
vita -f /path/to/roots.txt -c 400
```

Thanks to all the data source providers, and everyone else I can't seem to remember at this point 
in time. I'll make sure to add you in the future.

### To-do
* Add more paid sources.
* Write some documentation for the underlying library that Vita uses, and prepare publish to crates.io.
* Clean up types and optimise performance further.
